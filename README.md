# Market Microstructure Mini-Study - Basket Fair Value, Mispricing, and Order-Flow Signals

This repo analyzes intraday pricing and order book dynamics for four instruments:
**CHOCOLATE, STRAWBERRIES, ROSES,** and **GIFT_BASKET** (a bundle of the first three).
We explore co-movement, basket fair value, mispricing (spread & z-score), and simple
order-flow signals (microprice and volume imbalance).

## Files

- `round4_data_visualization.ipynb` - Reproducible notebook with all plots and commentary.
- `prices_round_3_day_0.csv` - Semicolon-delimited L1â€“L3 quotes and mid prices for one trading day.

## Data Schema (selected columns)

- `day`, `timestamp` (ms)
- `product` - {CHOCOLATE, STRAWBERRIES, ROSES, GIFT_BASKET}
- `bid_price_1..3`, `bid_volume_1..3`
- `ask_price_1..3`, `ask_volume_1..3`
- `mid_price`
- `profit_and_loss`

## Questions We Answer With Visuals

1. **Co-movement & Volatility** - Rebased price paths to compare trend and variance.
2. **Fair Value Check** - Does GIFT_BASKET align with a synthetic basket of its components?
3. **Mispricing & Z-Score** - Spread time series and z-score bands (|z| > 2) for mean-reversion cues.
4. **Order-Flow Pressure** - Microprice tendencies relative to bid/ask volume weights.
5. **Impact Curve** - Top-of-book volume imbalance vs. short-horizon future returns.
6. **Market Quality** - Typical spreads and depth asymmetry when mispricing is elevated.
